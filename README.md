NilDa is a small C++ implementation of different deep learning algorithms for machine learning applications.

The code leverage the Eigen library for efficient algebra operations and openCV for image/video handling.
The code started as a small personal project and its objective is not to compete with other famous codes in the
artificial intelligence world but, rather, it wants to offer a less intimidating experience for people that want to know
how machine learning algorithms work under the hood.
